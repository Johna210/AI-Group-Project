## Solving the knapsack problem using Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing & Genetic Algorithm

Read the problem decription for more info

Another assignment I worked on when taking Fundamentals of AI course, 3rd year 2nd semester

## Format to run the Knapsack implementation:-

     python main.py --algorithm [algorithmType] --file [knapfile]

algorithmType :

- 'hc' for hill climbing
- 'sa' for simulated annealing
- 'ga' for genetic algorithm
  Knapfile :
- knapfile10.txt for 10 items
- knapfile15.txt for 15 items
- knapfile20.txt for 20 items
